## HVamp - A Vamp host for Haskell

This package is a Vamp host for Haskell; it allows
[Vamp plugins](http://www.vamp-plugins.org/) to be loaded and executed
from Haskell code. (It does *not* allow Vamp plugins to be *written*
in Haskell.)

This code is currently in its very early stages and is not yet
generally usable.
